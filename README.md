#Pyriodic

_Pronounced just like "periodic"_

A job scheduler for running periodic tasks in Python.

This project is in the alpha stage so there is a lot yet to do.

---

##Installation

```
pip install pyriodic
```

---

##Dependencies

Pyriodic can be installed and used on it's own but if tasks need to be scheduled at a specific date/time then the module dateutil is invaluble. Without it acceptable datetime strings are rather limited.

If dateutil is already installed then it will be used automatically.

For the web front end to work CherryPy must be installed but it is entirely optional to use.

---

##Usage

```python
from pyriodic import DurationJob
from pyriodic import DatetimeJob
from pyriodic import Scheduler

now = datetime.now
s = Scheduler()

start = now()

def func1(arg1=None, arg2=None, arg3=None, arg4=None):
	print('Func1', arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, now() - start, now())

def func2():
	print('Func2', now() - start, now())

def func3():
	print('Func3', now() - start, now())

s.add_job(DurationJob(func1,
                    when='30m',
                    args=('This', 'is'),
                    kwargs={'arg3': 'the', 'arg4': 'first function'},
                    name='MyJob'))
s.add_job(DurationJob(func2, when='2h'))
s.add_job(DatetimeJob(func3, when='12:00 pm'))

print(s.next_run_times())
```
